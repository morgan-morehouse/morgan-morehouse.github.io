title: "W1D4: U.S. Cyber Trust Mark"
---

After reading this [article](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/07/white-house-launches-u-s-cyber-trust-mark-providing-american-consumers-an-easy-label-to-see-if-connected-devices-are-cybersecure/) I think that this is an interesting idea and seems like a good way to make Americans more aware of the devices in their home that they might not realize can be compromised. I wonder about how in-depth the assessments will be, and how much companies will try to adapt their products to get this label. I also am curious about the range/types of products that will be able to get this label. On another note, itâ€™s encouraging to hear that the vote was bipartisan and unanimous and that major companies also support it, although we will have to see if it actually gets implemented well.
