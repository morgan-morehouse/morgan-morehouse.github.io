The part of [cybersecurity](https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity) that interests me the most is _how teams within a company work together to stay secure_, and how _a red team tests the security_.  I hope to learn more about _Linux_, become _more comfortable_ using it, and learn about _the cybersecurity industry in general._
