The part of **[cybersecurity](https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity)** that interests me the most is how teams within a company work together to stay secure, and how a red team tests the security.  I hope to learn more about Linux, become more comfortable using it, and learn about the cybersecurity industry in general.
