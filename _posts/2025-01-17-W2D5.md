title: "W2D5: Popular online billing site leaks data of thousands of users"
---

After reading the [TechRadar article](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/popular-online-bill-paying-site-leaks-data-of-thousands-of-users), I wonder if the customers of Willow Pays have been notified by the company of the leak or if they are trying to keep it out of sight from the people who might have been affected. I also wonder if there is a way to figure out if any malicious parties accessed this database, as that is the main concern here. It seems very irresponsible that this company, which handles such sensitive information, would leave a large database like this unprotected. I also would think that they would try to use the expertise of Jeremiah Fowler to help them increase their cybersecurity, instead of not responding to his emails.
