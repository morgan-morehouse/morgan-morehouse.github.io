My documentation for the Bandit levels.

### Level 0
To get to level 0, we need to access Bandit using ssh on port 2220 using username **bandit0**:
```console
mmorehouse25@Morgan---Bay ~ % ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
Then enter the password **bandit0** to gain access.

### Level 0 &#8594; 1
Next, we have to find the password to level 1. This is stored in a file called `readme` located in the home directory. 
```console
bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
readme
bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme
ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If
```
This is the password for bandit1.

### Level 1 &#8594; 2
**NOTE: To end each previous level, type in `exit` to log out. To start each new level, use the same ssh format as before:  
(`ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`)  
but replace the zero in `bandit0` with the number of the level you are trying to access.**

For level 1, we are trying to find a file called `-` in the home directory. 
```console
bandit1@bandit:~$ ls
-
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat ./-

```

### Level 2 &#8594; 3
To get the next password, we need to find a file called `spaces in this filename`.
```console
bandit2@bandit:~$ ls
spaces in this filename
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat "spaces in this filename"
MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx
```

### Level 3 &#8594; 4
To get the next password, we need to find the hidden file in the `inhere` directory.
```console
bandit3@bandit:~$ ls
inhere
bandit3@bandit:~$ cd inhere
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -a
.  ..  ...Hiding-From-You
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ cat "...Hiding-From-You"
2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ
```

### Level 4 &#8594; 5
To get the next password, we need to find the only human-readable file in the `inhere` directory.
```console
bandit4@bandit:~$ ls
inhere
bandit4@bandit:~$ cd inhere
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -a
.   -file00  -file02  -file04  -file06  -file08
..  -file01  -file03  -file05  -file07  -file09
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ file ./*
./-file00: data
./-file01: data
./-file02: data
./-file03: data
./-file04: data
./-file05: data
./-file06: data
./-file07: ASCII text
./-file08: data
./-file09: data
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./-file07
4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw
```

### Level 5 &#8594; 6
The next password is stored in a file that is human-readable, 1033 bytes in size, and not executable, somewhere under the `inhere` directory.
```console
bandit5@bandit:~$ ls
inhere
bandit5@bandit:~$ cd inhere
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -a
.            maybehere02  maybehere06  maybehere10  maybehere14  maybehere18
..           maybehere03  maybehere07  maybehere11  maybehere15  maybehere19
maybehere00  maybehere04  maybehere08  maybehere12  maybehere16
maybehere01  maybehere05  maybehere09  maybehere13  maybehere17
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ find -size 1033c ! -executable
./maybehere07/.file2
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./maybehere07/.file2
HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG
```

### Level 6 &#8594; 7
The next password is stored in a file somewhere on the server and is owned by user bandit7, owned by group bandit6, and is 33 bytes in size. we can run `find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c` by itself, but adding `2>/dev/null` will hide all the "permission denied" messages.
```console
bandit6@bandit:/$ find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
bandit6@bandit:/$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj
```

### Level 7 &#8594; 8
The next password is next to the word millionth in the file `data.txt`.
```console
bandit6@bandit:/$ ls
data.txt
bandit7@bandit:~$ grep -n millionth data.txt
1457:millionth	dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc
```

### Level 8 &#8594; 9
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once
```console
bandit8@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
bandit8@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u
4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM
```

### Level 9 &#8594; 10
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.
```console
bandit9@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
bandit9@bandit:~$ strings data.txt | grep "=="
