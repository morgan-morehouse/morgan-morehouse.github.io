This is where I will be putting my notes for Bandit :)

### Level 0
To get to level 0, we need to access Bandit using ssh on port 2220 using username **bandit0**:
```shell
mmorehouse25@Morgan---Bay ~ % ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
Then enter the password **bandit0** to gain access.

### Level 0 &#8594; 1
Next, we have to find the password to level 1. This is stored in a file called _readme_ located in the home directory. 
```console
bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
readme
bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme
ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If
```
This is the password for bandit1. Now, type in `exit` to log out.

### Level 1 &#8594; 2
To start each new level, use the same ssh format at before (`ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`), but replace the zero in bandit0 with the number of the level you are tyring to access.
