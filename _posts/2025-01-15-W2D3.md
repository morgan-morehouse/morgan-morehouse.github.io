title: "W1D3: Read and Respond: US Removes Malware Allegedly Planted on Computers by Chinese-Backed Hackers"
---

My reaction to the [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/us-removes-malware-allegedly-planted-computers-by-chinese-backed-hackers-2025-01-14/) is a mix of surprise and curiosity. I am curious how long the malware was installed in these devices, how many people were impacted, and what information the hackers had access to. I am also a bit surprised at how long this malware has been used against the US, and I wonder if any action (besides deleting the malware off devices) will be taken. There also doesn't seem to be a lot of details in this article, so I would be interested in seeing if anything else comes out in the future.
